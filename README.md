# knitsoftware-newsite

It's my clean design for the KnitSoftware website. I hope to change the current page with the new and cleaner design.

I develop the page using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, Javascript (ES6), and React (Props, Hooks, Router, Formik, ContexAPI). It'll probobly include SASS as well.
